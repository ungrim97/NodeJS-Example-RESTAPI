# DESCRIPTION

This is designed an example NodeJS Rest API application showing all of the fixtures and fittings that
may be included in a production environment

The idea being that many examples and tutorials rarely sure examples of 'Production quality' code
that devs can actually use. Leaving a need to work out how best to architect them into the various
production service designs

# Docker

The Application can run in a docker container (1 for the application and 1 for the DB)

    npm run dev:db:start
    npm run dev:db:stop
The DB is available on 127.0.0.1:4406

    npm run dev:docker:start
    npm run dev:docker:stop
The Application is available on 127.0.0.1:9000

Starting the application server will automatically bring up the DB container
upon which if depends

# Running locally

You can run the dev server locally via the following commands

    npm run dev:db:start
    MS_DB_PORT=4406 npm run dev:fixtures:populate
    npm run dev:start

## Environment variables

The following environment variables are available to configure the system

- MS_DB_PORT: The port the database is available on
- MS_DB_HOST: The hostname of the database
- MS_DB_DATABASE: The database to connect to
- MS_DB_PASS: The password for the db user
- MS_DB_USER: The user of the database (default: message_app)

- MS_PORT: The Port to start the application on
- MS_BASE_URL: The base url of the application (default: http://localhost)
- MS_APP_LOG_LEVEL: The log level to output
- MS_ACCESS_LOG_FILE: The log filename to use for access logs
- MS_ERROR_LOG_FILE: The output error log filename

# CONTRIBUTING

Patches are both encouraged and welcome. All contributers are however asked to follow some simple
guidelines:

- **Add Tests**

    Tests ensure your change doesn't get broken in the future

- **Document Changes**

    Documentation ensures people are aware of your change

- **Use feature branches**

    Feature branches help keep your changes easily accessible

- **One branch per feature**

    Independant branches ensure your change can be accepted independant of other changes

- **Atomic commits**

    Meaningful atomic commits help people understand the history of your change. Try and avoid commits like 'Fix typo' or 'fix broken test' by squashing them with the original change they fix. Commits like 'Implement test for feature X' and 'Modify X to achive Y' are more helpful.
