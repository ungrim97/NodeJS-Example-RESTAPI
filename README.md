# DESCRIPTION

This is designed an example NodeJS Rest API application showing all of the fixtures and fittings that
may be included in a production environment

The idea being that many examples and tutorials rarely sure examples of 'Production quality' code
that devs can actually use. Leaving a need to work out how best to architect them into the various
production service designs

# CONTRIBUTING

Patches are both encouraged and welcome. All contributers are however asked to follow some simple
guidelines:

- **Add Tests**

    Tests ensure your change doesn't get broken in the future

- **Document Changes**

    Documentation ensures people are aware of your change

- **Use feature branches**

    Feature branches help keep your changes easily accessible

- **One branch per feature**

    Independant branches ensure your change can be accepted independant of other changes

- **Atomic commits**

    Meaningful atomic commits help people understand the history of your change. Try and avoid commits like 'Fix typo' or 'fix broken test' by squashing them with the original change they fix. Commits like 'Implement test for feature X' and 'Modify X to achive Y' are more helpful.
